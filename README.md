Azusa Pacific University Web Design Project\
Completed by Blake Spencer and Emma Lee in Spring 2019

This website was created to host video game themed recipes together. 
We created multiple pages as well as custom designs for the icons, header, and footer. 

The pages we made are as follows: about us, all recipes, submit, email, user, login, signup, home page.

We created a relational database to store both user data and recipe data. We were able to authenticate users and sort recipes efficiently.\
The home page includes icons for the various series we included. Clicking an icon would take you to recipes from that series.\
The submit page allowed users to submit their own recipes, and the email page allowed users to email them directly to us.\
The user page allowed users to view their information and logout. It was dynamic and asked users to login or create an account if they did not have a current session.
